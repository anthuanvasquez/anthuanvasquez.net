        Hi, I'm Anthuan VÃ¡squez, a {{ age }} years old Developer.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-3">
        I'm a guy passionate for the technology, honest and a self-taught
        Front-End Developer. I consider myself as a person with initiative, who
        loves to take on new responsibilities, learning new things and face
        great challanges.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-3">
        With over {{ yearsOfExperience }} years of experience in the web
        industry. I am qualified in evaluating business requirements and
        outreach plans for current and future success. I'm a self-taught
        Front-End Developer with an emphasis on scalability, robustness and high
        availability. I've been working with WordPress since January 2010 with
        version 2.9. I have worked in all versions since. In December 2014 I
        started my first steps in Magento version 1.9.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-3">
        I have worked with different brands, different needs and different
        roles, like to work with different aspects of the front-end.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-3">
        I specialize in the visual appearance of the websites or rather in their
        design, taking into account the technical requirements, functionality
        and user considerations, besides working with the back-end in the
        creation of modules / plugins in Magento and WordPress. As a Front-End
        developer, I have a great understanding of what it means, to provide
        high availability of Web applications and user experience.
